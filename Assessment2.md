### **Assessment 2: Intermediate Recursion**
*Goal*: Strengthen recursion concepts and introduce problems involving recursion with arrays.

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
   Write a recursive function to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number.  
   *Input*: `n = 6`  
   *Output*: `8`

2. **Sum of Array Elements**  
   Use recursion to find the sum of all elements in an array.  
   *Input*: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
   *Output*: `15`

3. **Find Maximum in an Array**  
   Write a recursive function to find the maximum element in an array.  
   *Input*: `arr = [1, 4, 3, -1, 7]`  
   *Output*: `7`

4. **Power Function**  
   Use recursion to calculate `x^n` (x raised to the power of n).  
   *Input*: `x = 2, n = 5`  
   *Output*: `32`

5. **Subset Generation (Power Set)**  
   Write a recursive function to generate all subsets of a given array.  
   *Input*: `arr = [1, 2]`  
   *Output*: `[[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]`

6. **Tower of Hanoi**  
   Write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for `n` disks.  
   *Input*: `n = 3`  
   *Output*: Steps to move all disks from source to destination.
