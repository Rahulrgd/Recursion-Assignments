# Recursion, Backtracking, and Dynamic Programming Assessments

This repository contains a set of 8 assessments designed to help students build their skills in recursion, backtracking, and dynamic programming (DP). The questions range from beginner to advanced levels, ensuring a gradual progression in complexity and covering commonly asked interview problems for developers with up to 2 years of experience.

---

## **Structure of the Assessments**
Each assessment contains 6-8 problems. The assessments are structured as follows:

1. **Assessment 1**: Basic recursion problems to build a strong foundation.
2. **Assessment 2**: Slightly advanced recursion and introduction to backtracking.
3. **Assessment 3**: Classic backtracking problems, including combinatorial problems.
4. **Assessment 4**: Transition from backtracking to dynamic programming with basic DP problems.
5. **Assessment 5**: Intermediate DP problems with a focus on 1D arrays.
6. **Assessment 6**: Advanced DP problems with 2D arrays.
7. **Assessment 7**: Real-world advanced DP problems and applications.
8. **Assessment 8**: Challenging problems combining recursion, backtracking, and DP.

## **How to Use This Repository**

1. **For Students**: 
   - Start with **Assessment 1** and progress sequentially to ensure a proper understanding of concepts.
   - Attempt each problem and refer to explanations or hints (if provided) only after multiple attempts.

2. **For Instructors**:
   - Assign one assessment at a time and provide a timeline for completion.
   - Review solutions and provide feedback to guide students effectively.
